# C# .NET Core Clean Architecture & CQRS Project Template [WIP]

This repository provides a comprehensive project template for implementing Clean Architecture and CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) with the help of nArchitecture Course by Engin Demirog in C# .NET Core. It includes best practices and advanced implementations to help you build scalable, maintainable, and testable applications.

## Key Features

### Core Architecture and Design Principles

- **Clean Architecture with DDD:** Implement Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles within a clean architecture framework.
- **CQRS Implementation:** Separate command and query responsibilities for better scalability and maintainability.
- **SOLID Principles and Clean Code:** Adhere to SOLID principles and clean code techniques for a robust codebase.
- **Advanced Repository Pattern:** Implement both synchronous and asynchronous repositories for efficient data handling.
- **Dynamic Search Implementation:** Create dynamic and flexible search functionalities within the application.
- **Automapper for Mapping:** Use Response-Request pattern-based mapping with Automapper for smooth object transformations.
- **Advanced Entity Framework Integration:** Follow best practices for Entity Framework Core implementations.
- **API Development:** Build RESTful APIs with a focus on best practices and scalability.
- **Extension Methods:** Learn to write and use extension methods to enhance code readability and reusability.

### Domain Modeling and Application Infrastructure

- **Complex Domain Modeling:** Model complex and related domain entities effectively.
- **Advanced Mapping Techniques:** Implement advanced mapping strategies between domain models and data transfer objects.
- **Migrations with EF Core:** Manage database schema changes with Entity Framework Core migrations.
- **Business Rules and Clean Code:** Implement business logic following clean code principles.
- **Global Error Handling:** Integrate global error handling to manage exceptions consistently.
- **Pipeline Development:** Create custom pipelines for various application tasks.
- **Validation Pipeline:** Use Fluent Validation for input validation within the pipeline.
- **Transactional Operations:** Implement a transaction pipeline for managing transactional operations.

### Caching and Logging

- **Caching Pipeline Implementation:** Develop caching strategies within the pipeline for improved performance.
- **In-Memory and Redis Caching:** Integrate both In-Memory and Redis caching solutions.
- **Logging Pipeline:** Implement a robust logging pipeline to capture and manage application logs.
- **Serilog Integration:** Use Serilog for structured and flexible logging.

### Security and Communication

- **Security and JWT Implementation:** Secure your APIs with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and authorization.
- **Mailing Implementation:** Integrate mailing capabilities for sending emails within the application.

### Testing and Mocking

- **Test-Driven Infrastructure Development:** Build a test-driven infrastructure to ensure high code quality.
- **Moq for Unit Testing:** Use Moq for mocking dependencies in unit tests.
